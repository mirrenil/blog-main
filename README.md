## A simple blog built with react and firebase 

### This is a project which Im working on during the summer break. 
The backend is built with firebase and the frontend with react.
Im using the firebase database and storage to save both blog posts and images.
A user can create an account and once signed in (auth) he/she can blog and include images if wanted.

##
```
npm i
npm start
Run the server on http://localhost:3000
```
